# RuralGrocery

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RuralGrocery is to provide an R based tool to help users with decision-making
for opening up a grocery store in a rural environment. The tool itself is an R Shiny app
which uses the functions from the DSPGrocery package to generate market size, 
estimated revenue, expenses and other demographic information.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RuralGrocery from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Indicators-ISUEO/RuralGrocery")
```

## Background

The R Shiny tool and the RuralGrocery package are designed as alternative interfaces to an Excel tool
developed by the ISU Extension and Outreach Farm, Food and Enterprise Development Program. The Excel
workbooks are divided into the following three sections.

 - Estimating Market Size
 - Estimating Revenue
 - Estimating Expenses
 
These correspond to the articles in the vignette sections documenting how each of the excel tools were first converted into R functions and later updated to suit the needs of the R Shiny interface. Those articles can be found in the `Articles` tab on the navigation bar.
